### Summary and Key Notes

In A Revolutionary Cipher (2018), John F. Dooley explores the vocabulary of cryptology, the differences between codes and ciphers and the discussion of how to decipher unknown messages. Dooley explains these concepts through the rich and dramatic history of cryptology that dates back to the first developments of language. He also utilizes images, examples and definitions to further describe the topic. This chapter stresses the very human tendency of secrecy and yearning for privacy that is only amplified as the languages and mediums we use to communicate become more and more complex.
