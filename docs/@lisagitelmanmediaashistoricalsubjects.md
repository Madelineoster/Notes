### Summary and Key Notes

In this introduction titled; Media as Historical Subjects (2006), Lisa Gitelman examines the ways that media are studied as historical subjects. Gitelman chronologically develops these ideas through the use of the examples of recorded sound and the World Wide Web in their historical contexts. By exploring this, she asserts that looking into the novelty years, transitional states, and identity crises of different media, we are able to uncover the broad conditions by which media and communication have been shaped.
