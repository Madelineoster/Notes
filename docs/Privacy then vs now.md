As stated in [@johnfdooleyarevolutionarycipher], privacy was a privelage not afforded to those who sent letters, as letters were often opened and read before they reached their intended recipient. It is interesting to note how ideas of privacy have changed. Nowadays we have an assumed sense of privacy but yet put all of our private information online. It is definitely not much better with social media selling our information and constantly watching our every move to better sell us things. One thing remains true, humans will always desire privacy, but also always be obsessed with prying into others personal information.
