In The Amherst Method, Wayne Weigmand contributes new information to the historiography on the origins of the Decimal Classification and the many contextual forces influencing the classification structure. Weigmand explores these concepts by dissecting Dewey's thought process and making note of the many intellectuals who paved the way for Dewey's system. This aims to clarify the many discrepancies surrounding the origins of this famous system and grants credit to many of the unacknowledged minds behind it.
