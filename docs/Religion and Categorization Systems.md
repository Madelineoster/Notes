The mention that "Monasteries played a major role in education as they were the primary places for preservation and production in the middle ages" from [@shivkumarfromclaytabletstoweb] makes me think of Dewey and the influence of Protestantism in his work. The relation between religion and the categorization systems created through history is interesting. [@wayneweigmanddeweydecimal]
