### Summary and Key Notes 

In Vannevar Bush's, As We May Think (1945), he asserts that as scientists emerge from their war efforts, they must now focus their attention to granting people accessibility and command to the knowledge of the world. Bush develops this idea by documenting the discipline of science through history, and how the state of the world usually focuses scientists, like war. This fact leads to his main argument, that with the state of the world, and the growing amount of research and information, there is an increasing necesity for an effective way of storing and accessing this material.
