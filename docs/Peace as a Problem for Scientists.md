It is interesting how peace can provide a dilemma for physicists. For many people actually. When there isn't an urgent need for specified efforts for a common cause, it can be difficult to find purpose. War although unsavory, has provided a base for the furthering of the physical sciences. Now, as Bush mentions, new efforts need to be made for a different cause.
