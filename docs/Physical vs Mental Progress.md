At a time when everything physical in our lives is made to be easier and more convenient because of technological advancements, what else are we left with other than furthering our minds. And when we have all of the worlds information at our fingertips, we have to find new ways of fathoming this. There is so much work to be done surrounding the ways we interpret, contribute to and use information, as a means of furthering the powers of the mind. I am also interested in how the layout of our minds have changed because of this constant and easy access to everything we could ever need and want to know.
