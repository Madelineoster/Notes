There is a definite relation between power and knowledge. In [@johnfdooleyarevolutionarycipher] we can see this in regards to secret knowledge. The knowledge of what messages are being spread, secretly or not, has so much power to it. To be in full control of a group of people, it is best to be all-knowing.
