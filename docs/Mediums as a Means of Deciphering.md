It is interesting to note how much mediums matter in deciphering context. Because of how much cursive writing has fallen out of practice, the deciphered letter shown in [@johnfdooleyarevolutionarycipher] is nearly impossible for someone of the more recent generation to read, but that generation is much more attuned to interpreting the internet. They are almost two different languages based on your personal background and the time you grew up in. It reminds me of a concept we learned in class, perspectivism; the understanding that the way we record info matters and that engagement with the material depends on this.
